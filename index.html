        <p class="paragraph-1"> Roger Pouncey is a musician and aspiring developer based in Richmond, VA. Roger has been
            playing guitar for 20 years. In 2015 he graduated Summa Cum Laude from VCU’s Jazz Studies program with a
            Bachelor of Music Performance. While at VCU, Roger had the opportunity to play with a wide variety of
            visiting artists including bassist and Mingus Big Band leader Boris Kozlov, Vanguard Orchestra saxophonist
            Dick Oatts, Maria Schneider Orchestra saxophonist Steve Wilson, and percussionist Efrain Toro. During his
            time at VCU, Roger garnered many awards and scholarships, including the Gin Robertson Scholarship and the
            Richmond Jazz Society’s Joseph J. Kennedy Junior Jazz music scholarship. </p>

        <p> Roger was chosen two years in a row to take part in a partnership with the University of Kwazulu-Natal in
            Durban, South Africa. The program brought together one small ensemble each from VCU and UKZN to compose and
            perform original music that explored the United States’ and South Africa’s shared history of racism and the
            civil rights. The program culminated in performances by both groups on stages in the United States and
            Durban, South Africa. Roger is also a composer and arranger, having written for, among others, the
            aforementioned exchange program, VCU’s Jazz Orchestras, and his own groups. Most recently Roger was
            commissioned to arrange a big band piece for Grammy-Award-Winning percussionist John Santos.</p>

        <p> In 2019, Roger decided to pursue a career change that would allow him more time with his family. He began
            self-teaching web development using online resources such as Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp. His interest grew
            quickly, and it soon became apparent that a career as a developer would be a wonderful alternative to
            <del>babysitting</del> teaching. In 2020, Roger enrolled in the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp program.</p>

        <p> While Roger looks to a career in web development to replace certain aspects of the professional musician life, he
            still intends to pursue musical activities that interest him, such as writing and performing. Roger performs
            regularly throughout the region as both a sideman and a leader. He leads the jazz trio every Sunday at the
            Jefferson Hotel brunch. </p>
